      "We were almost a month in New York staying at Tia Lyda's house. It was an 'easy' experience since we both knew the city and speak the language. It came with many pleasant surprises like seeing Jaco, our nephew. But also, wondering around the city and driving a Jeep and an Audi A5.",

      "Also, almost a month here in Spain. It was harder than New York because we didn't know the country nor the culture. Still, it is a culture not so different from ours, so I would consider it wasn't a hard experience. We had a lot of fun and even though we struggle to get used to their traditions, it was a pleasant stay and would totally come back.",

      "Italy was the hardest of our experiences so far. The trip started harsh with the public transport closed and a taxi that charged us 40 euros for a 10 minute trip. Also, I lost my job so every cent started to count. We still loved our road trip to the Tuscany, there were some views that I never thought I was gonna see. And we could stay at places I never imagined.",
